I have been a longterm [Wordpress](https://wordpress.com) user and quite happy with it. But having a full-blown CMS system for a rather small blog incurred too much maintenance (Wordpress ships a lot of important security updates) and complexity (I have to maintain an own MySQL database) burden on me. Therefore I decided to give [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) a try to generate my blog and store it on the Amazon S3 service, host it with the Cloudfront CDN service and maintain the domain with the Amazon Route 53 service. 

###Cost
Before the move to Amazon Webservice I have been using [Hosteurope](https://www.hosteurope.de) for almost a decade. I have been quite happy with them but wanted to move over to Amazon because I am using their plattform, and I don't need a classic PHP hosting anymore. For the pricing comparison I calculated a very optmistic (in the sense that the blog will create traffic) load on my Amazon hosting and compared that with the Hosteurope cost. 

####Hosteurope
For Hosteurope I have to pay the following costs for a reasonable setup to host the wordpress installation 

| Position      | Cost (year)  |
| ------------- | ------------:|
| Domain        | € 7.20       |
| Hosting       | € 71,88      |
| Total         | € 79,08      |

####Amazon

for Amazon Webservices I created a [price calculation](http://calculator.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html#key=calc-B4E6EDFE-EB3F-4A1A-B538-D90258812BB7). Because I am not a new customer, I will have to pay the full price of 18.14 € (incl. VAT) per year. Adding an external domain service to keep my domain registered costs me at [United Domains](https://www.united-domains.de) 15 € per year, because they provide native support for external nameserver like Amazon Route 53. I end up with the following prices

| Position      | Cost (year)  |
| ------------- | ------------:|
| Domain        | € 15.0       |
| Hosting       | € 18.14      |
| Total         | € 33.14      |

so the saving are *45.94* which does not seem a lot in total but is still only 42% of the former price.

###Maintenance
For the blog itself I am using the following tools 

* [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) as the site generator. I did quite a research and have been favoring Java static-site generators to avoid ruby problems on my machine. But I ended up with Jekyll because of the best documentation so far and th best support for themes and plugins. 
* [Minimal mistake theme](http://mademistakes.com/articles/minimal-mistakes-jekyll-theme/) I had a look into different themes and personally liked the minimal mistake theme most. 
* [S3 Wesbite](https://github.com/laurilehmijoki/s3_website) I used the S3 Website plugin to upload my file
* [Github](https://github.com) I am maintaining my website on a public github fork from the minimal mistake theme repository. With that I can receive the updates done in the theme itself.

###Installation
Except for the need to install rdoc before actually running the Jekyll installation described in their getting started. 
    {% raw %}
		gem install rdoc
    {% endraw %}

###Further steps 
After doing the initial start I am planning to add some more plugins to the Jekyll installation to bring up feature like sitemap creation etc. So far I am pretty happy with the change and feel to have a more _leightweight_ solution at my fingertips.
