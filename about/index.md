I am a software developer, developing software since 1999 and professionally since 2001 using Java and popular Open-Source frameworks to build enterprise applications. Currently I run the german devision of [mimacom](http://www.mimacom.de) a company with around 150 employees in europe.

Before running mimacom I was a employee of Interface21/SpringSource that has been aquired by VMware and became [Pivotal](http://www.gopivotal.com) in 2013. I have a broad experience applying Open-Source technologies to create enterprise software solutions in the banking, finance, insurance, healthcare, logistics and government industries. Besides technology I am keen into domain [driven design](http://dddcommunity.org) and have implemented core-domain implementations for retail, logistics, healthcare and government solutions.

####Open Source
I am currently closely following/contributing to the following Open-Source projects

* I am [Spring.IO](http://www.spring.io) a long term (ca. 2003 - 2004 ) user of the Spring Framework project and have also contributed to different projects as an external contributor or employee of Interface21/SpringSource
* [Elasticsearch](http://www.elasticsearch.org) is used by me during customer projects in the retail and finance industry. I am a long term [Lucene](http://www.lucene.apache.org) user and moved from Lucene over Solr to Elasticsearch. I am a co-organizer of the Stuttgart [Elasticsearch Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Elasticsearch-Stuttgart/)
* [Cloud Foundry](http://cloudfoundry.org/) I am a Cloud Foundry user and help customers to implement Cloud Foundry installations inside their data center or the Amazon Webservice Plattform

####Amazon Webservices
Besides Open-Source I am using and closely following the [Amazon Webservice Plattform](https://aws.amazon.com) since 2006 and have a broad experience using the Amazon Services along with the Java SDK and different services like S3, EC2, Elasticbeanstalk, SNS, SQS, Elasticache, SES.

####Personal
I am born and grown-up in [Stuttgart](http://www.stuttgart.de) the so called "cradle of the automobile". My parents immigrated to germany around 45 years ago from the [Republic of Yugoslavia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialist_Federal_Republic_of_Yugoslavia).
